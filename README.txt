                                RUNNING
===============================================================================


* The client
It is very simple to run the client. All you need to do is open the Client
directory and double click Diamond.exe. It will then open the main game and
let you login and so on. Note: Server must be running.

* The server
To run the server, you need to do a few things. First go into your Server
directory. You will notice the file "Data", double click that. Inside you'll
find many options for max settings. Change those as you will. There's various
other options you can change, such as your game's name. Do this before you
run the Server.exe, so all your files will be configured properly. You can
also change any other files in the server folder, if you know what you're
doing. After you get a basic understanding on the files, go ahead and run
the server. After it loads up, other people can connect to your computer!

                                TROUBLESHOOTING
===============================================================================

* General
For any problems, it is best to go to the community forum and post a bug report
so the developers can look into it and help you fix it.

* Reading the error list
The error list will keep your server from randomly crashing in most cases. It
isn't hard at all to read and understand what errors your server has avoided.
Just post your errorlist.txt, located in the Server folder, on the forum and
people will interpret it for you.

I. Intro
--------------------------------
Welcome to the scripting guide! This guide will help you with some basic
scripting for Konfuze, its fairly simple ;) If you know some Visual Basic
then I suggest you just skip this guide and have fun coding! If you dont
know any VB then please continue reading this.

--------------------------------
II. Basic Scripting
--------------------------------
One of the basic things you need to learn in VB is the IF statement, it
looks something like:
If Value1 = Value2 Then

End if
 
Simple eh? Well what this does is checks if value 1 = to value 2 and if
it does continue with the code, otherwise skip the whole if to end if.
You can also do:

if value1 > value2 then
  -continue if more then
if value1 < value2 then
  -continue if less then
if value1 <> value2 then
  -continue if not equal to
if value1 => value2 then
  -continue if equal or more then
if value1 =< value2 then
  -continue if equal or less then


Another basic thing you will need is dimming. Something like Dim I. This
will just make a variable which can store data. Here is how to store to
it:
i = data

retrieve:
data = i

Well that was simple... Dont forget you only need to put Dim *variable
name* at the top once.

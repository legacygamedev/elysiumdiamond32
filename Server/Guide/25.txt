:: Usable Subs ::
          Sub JoinGame(index) - This sub executes once someone enters the game. Generally contains the welcome message and MOTD. This sub can be used to run a command for newbies, like giving them weapons, or for setting other variables for special events.

          Sub LeftGame(index) - This sub executes once someone leaves the game. This sub is most useful for checking a character when it exits so there are no problems when they return.

          Sub PlayerLevelUp(index) - This sub runs through the level up process. It displays a message and awards the points for levels.

          Sub UsingStatPoints(index, PointType) - This sub runs through the point distribution.

          Sub ScriptedTile(index, Script) - This sub is for your scripted tiles. The tiles are executed when someone steps onto a tile holding the scripted attribute. You place the attribute down through the map editor. Each script in here is given a case number for identification, be sure to match it up correctly!

          Sub PlayerPrompt(index, Prompt, Value) - This sub is for your message box prompts, the yes or no questions. =)

          Sub Commands(index) - In this sub you will find all your commands. These are the commands you use in game and they are the "Slash commands."

          Sub DropItems(index) - This sub is for dropping items onto your map. It executes ondeath.

          Sub OnDeath(index) - This sub holds the information when you die. It restores the player to their respawn point and executes when they die.

    With the source code it is possible to add more subs. There is currently a tutorial, written by yours truely, that explains this. < http://www.splamm.com/elysium/forums/ >

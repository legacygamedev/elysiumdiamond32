:: Config.ini ::
Just like the server stuff, we will analyze the main files. This is config.ini.

There are only a few options that we need to edit.


[UPDATER]
FileName=The file name of the client (Diamond.exe)
WebSite=Your game's website url
[IPCONFIG]
IP=The server's IP address to connect to
PORT=The port to connect to (4000)


There isn't much to change.


:: Credits ::
It's really simple. Just edit "credits.txt" for your purposes. It isn't hard!


:: GUI ::
Now, in the "GUI" folder there are a bunch of images. If you want to make a new GUI, you can just edit the images with any image editor. Be sure to edit "colors.txt" with the color values you want to use for many features.

- d. Developers
Elysium Guide v 1.0
Written by pingu


:: The basics ::
Developers are in charge of creating the game play part of the game. Mappers do the graphics, developers do the content. As I said in the overall description, these guys are REALLY powerful and there is not much difference between a creator. More than any other times, make sure you pick a person you know as a developer. You could find yourself with nothing left if you don't.


:: The commands ::
Note, in all of the below commands, you can switch "/editthing" to "/thingeditor" and it will work just as well. Almost all of the things below have extra explaining in another part of this guide.

/edititem - Opens up the item editor for creating/editing items that can be used by players.

/editarrow - Opens up the arrow editor for creating arrows for bows.

/editemoticon - Opens up the emoticon editor.

/editnpc - Opens up the NPC editor so you can create computer controlled "players". 

/editshop - Opens up the shop editor for creation of a shop.

/editspell - Opens up the spell editor for creating spells that players can use.

/editspeech - Opens up the speech editor for creating NPC speech.
